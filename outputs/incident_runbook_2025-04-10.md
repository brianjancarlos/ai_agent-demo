# Incident Response Runbook: Java OutOfMemoryError - Service Process Request Failure

**Incident ID:** 2023-10-27-XYZ-MemoryLeak
**Date/Time of Incident:** 2023-10-27 14:30 UTC
**Service Affected:** XYZ Service (Service.processRequest())
**Severity:** High

## 1. Incident Summary

This runbook outlines the steps to respond to an incident where the XYZ Service experienced a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error, primarily due to a memory leak within the XYZ Caching System.  The initial impact resulted in service unavailability, requiring immediate mitigation and subsequent preventative measures.

## 2. Root Cause

* **Primary Cause:**  Memory Leak within the XYZ Caching System.  Specifically, unidentified code within the caching system is accumulating memory without proper release mechanisms.
* **Contributing Factors:**
    * **Uncontrolled Data Growth:** The caching system's data accumulation is exacerbating the problem.
    * **Potential Data Structures:** Likely utilizes maps (HashMap, HashTable) or hash tables within the caching system, which, if not managed carefully, can lead to memory exhaustion.
    * **Lack of Monitoring:** Insufficient monitoring of the XYZ caching system's memory usage allowed the issue to escalate.


## 3. Immediate Actions (Stabilization – Time Estimate: 60-90 Minutes)

| Action                               | Responsible Party    | Estimated Time | Notes                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Scale Up JVM Heap                 | SRE Team              | 15-30 mins     | Increase -Xmx setting by 50-100% to provide temporary relief.       |
| 2. Restart Service Instances         | SRE Team              | 15-30 mins     | Prioritize restarting service instances experiencing the highest load. |
| 3. Traffic Shaping/Rate Limiting     | SRE Team              | Immediate      | Reduce incoming request volume to the service (e.g., via API gateway). |
| 4. Analyze Recent Deployments          | DevOps Team           | 15-30 mins     | Check for recent deployments impacting the XYZ Service or caching system. |
| 5. Check Service Logs (Detailed)      | SRE Team             | 15-30 mins     | Analyze detailed service logs for patterns related to the memory issue. |

## 4. Long-Term Actions (Remediation & Prevention – Time Estimate: 24-72 Hours)

| Action                               | Responsible Party    | Estimated Time | Notes                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Implement JVM Memory Profiling     | SRE Team/Dev Team     | 4-8 Hours      | Configure JProfiler, VisualVM, or YourKit for continuous monitoring. |
| 2. Code Review (Caching System)       | Dev Team             | 8-16 Hours     | Thorough review of the caching system code, focusing on memory management.   |
| 3. Implement TTL (Time-To-Live)      | Dev Team             | 4-8 Hours      | Enforce appropriate TTL values for cached data.                           |
| 4. Data Size Limits                 | Dev Team             | 4-8 Hours      | Implement limits on data size stored in the cache.                        |
| 5. Enhance Monitoring & Alerting      | SRE Team             | 4-8 Hours      | Configure alerts for key memory metrics (heap usage, GC frequency).    |
| 6.  Load Testing                    | QA Team/Dev Team     | 8-16 Hours     | Conduct load tests to identify the root cause and validate fixes.        |
| 7.  Update Documentation            | SRE Team             | 2-4 Hours      | Update incident response procedures and knowledge base articles.          |

## 5. Lessons Learned

* **Insufficient Monitoring:**  Lack of proactive monitoring of the XYZ caching system’s memory usage is a critical failure point.
* **Code Review Importance:**  This incident highlights the need for more rigorous code reviews, specifically focusing on memory management in complex systems.
* **Automated Testing:**  Implement automated load and stress tests to proactively identify memory-related issues.
* **Incident Response Training:**  Reinforce training on incident response procedures, especially regarding memory leaks.
